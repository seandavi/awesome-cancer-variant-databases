# awesome-cancer-variant-databases
A community-maintained repository of cancer clinical knowledge bases and databases focused on cancer and normal variants. [Contributions welcome](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-cancer-variant-databases/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md]).

# Cancer

## Clinically-focused

- [CanDL](https://candl.osu.edu/) - an expert-curated database of potentially actionable driver mutations for molecular pathologists and laboratory directors to facilitate literature-based annotation of genomic testing of tumors. [web app, Download]
- [CiViC](https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/#/home) - CIViC is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. [web app, API, Download]
- [DGIdb](http://dgidb.genome.wustl.edu/) - Mining the druggable genome for personalized medicine. [web app, API, Download]
- [Database of Curated Mutations (DOCM)](http://docm.genome.wustl.edu/) - DoCM, the Database of Curated Mutations, is a highly curated database of known, disease-causing mutations that provides easily explorable variant lists with direct links to source citations for easy verification. [web app, API, Download]
- [JAX Lab Clinical Knowledge Base](https://ckb.jax.org/) - The Jackson Laboratory Clinical Knowledgebase (CKB) is a semi-automated/manually curated database of gene/variant annotations, therapy knowledge, diagnostic/prognostic information, and clinical trials related to oncology. [web app]
- [MyCancerGenome](https://www.mycancergenome.org/) - My Cancer Genome is a personalized cancer medicine knowledge resource for physicians, patients, caregivers and researchers.  My Cancer Genome gives up-to-date information on what mutations make cancers grow and related therapeutic implications, including available clinical trials. [web app, API, Download, *may require licensing*]
- [Precision Medicine KnowledgeBase (PMKB)](https://pmkb.weill.cornell.edu/) - PMKB is organized to provide information about clinical cancer variants and interpretations in a structured way, as well as allowing users to submit and edit existing entries for continued growth of the knowledgebase. All changes are reviewed by cancer pathologists. [web app, Download]
